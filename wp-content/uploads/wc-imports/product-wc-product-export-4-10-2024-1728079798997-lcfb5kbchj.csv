This boat offers 16” tubes like the Stryker LX 320, but in the size that is still suitable as a yacht tender and also for recreational use with your rv or fishing on your favourite lake for the day.\n<h3><strong>Material &amp; Construction:</strong></h3>\nThe Stryker LX 270 comes with the additional bottom protection of 1.2mm fabric with our signature <em>Stryker Shield®</em> hull protection. <em>Stryker Shield</em>® is an 8” wide corrugated rubber strip that protects the bottom of the tubes and keel.   Stryker Inflatable Boats are constructed with the highest grade imported German Mehler PVC using the latest thermowelding technology.  Thermowelding is a process using heat welding that bonds the material together that creates superior strength and durability over the traditional 4 layer overlapping seam technology used by most companies.\n\nOur signature LX line features 5 <a

plastic 3 piece transoms) found on all other inflatable boats on the market.  The 15"" transom gives you the ability to add a short shaft prop outboard motor.\n\nThis vessel offers 4 Air Chambers, 1139lbs weight capacity and maximum 4 person capacity.  Stryker Inflatable Boats are constructed with a heavy duty interlocking aluminum floor system with side stringers or a high pressure air floor constructed from a specially designed drop-stitched PVC fabric.\n<h3><strong>Motor Recommendation for the Stryker LX 270:</strong></h3>\n9.9HP short shaft prop outboard, electric motor, or use the oars to row to shore.  This is the perfect setup for 1-2 people and your gear.\n<h3><strong>Included:</strong></h3>\nEvery boat comes fully equipped with military grade wrap around life line,

This is a great fit for 2-3 people and your gear, offering a max rating of 5 people. This inflatable pairs nicely with a 9.8HP motor.","<h3><strong>Stryker LX 320 Overview:</strong></h3>\nThe Stryker LX 320 is an extremely popular choice for anglers and boating enthusiasts looking for a light weight fully optioned boat. The Stryker LX 320 comes with the additional bottom protection of 1.2mm fabric with our signature <em>Stryker Shield®</em> hull protection. <em>Stryker Shield</em>® is an 8” wide corrugated rubber strip that protects the bottom of the tubes and keel.  Stryker Inflatable Boats are constructed with the highest grade imported German Mehler PVC using the latest thermowelding technology.  Thermowelding is a process using heat welding that bonds the material together that creates superior strength and durability over the traditional 4 layer overlapping seam technology used by most companies.\n<h3><strong>Material &amp; Construction:</strong></h3>\nOur signature LX line features 5 <a href=""https://strykerboats.com/product/scotty-glue-on-pad-for-inflatable-boats-black/"">Scotty® bases</a> pre-installed at time of manufacturing to plug and play up to 30 different <a href=""https://strykerboats.com/product-category/stryker-inflatable-boat-accessories/scotty/"">Scotty® accessories</a> for all your fishing adventures.\n\nThe  LX 320 inflatable boat features a 15” heavy duty 1 piece reinforced aluminum transom.  The Stryker fully welded aluminum transom removes the most common failure point (wood and plastic 3 piece transoms) found on all other inflatable boats on the market.  The 15"" transom gives you the ability to add a short shaft prop outboard motor.  This is a great fit for 2-3 people and your gear, offering a max rating of 5 people.\n\nThis vessel offers 4 Air Chambers, 1523lbs weight capacity.  Stryker Inflatable Boats are constructed with a heavy duty interlocking aluminum floor system with side stringers or a high pressure air floor constructed from a specially designed drop-stitched PVC fabric.\n<h3><strong>Motor Recommendation for the Stryker LX 320:</strong></h3>\n9.9HP short shaft prop outboard, or an electric motor.\n\nEvery boat comes fully equipped with military grade wrap around life line, multiple heavy duty D-ring systems installed throughout,  fuel tank/battery box tie down, heavy duty transom motor mount,  towing eyes on bow, with heavy duty D-handle for use with <a href=""https://strykerboats.com/product/stryker-launching-wheels-standard/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Stryker

The Stryker HD 420 comes with all the standard features of the LX lineup plus 5 air chambers, 2 extra Scotty Bases® (7 in total), 1.8mm material for hull with our signature Stryker Shield® and additional seating protection. A sun shade bimini top and 2 Scotty® Baitcaster rod holders are included. Our HD lineup features 7 Scotty® bases pre-installed at time of manufacturing to plug and play up to 30 different Scotty® accessories for all your fishing adventures.\n\nStryker Inflatable Boats are constructed with the highest grade imported German Mehler PVC using the latest thermowelding technology.  Thermowelding is a process using heat welding that bonds the material together that creates superior strength and durability over the traditional 4 layer overlapping seam technology used by most companies.\n\nThe HD 420 inflatable boat features a 15” heavy duty 1 piece reinforced aluminum transom.  The Stryker fully welded aluminum transom removes the most common failure point (wood and plastic 3 piece transoms) found on all other inflatable boats on the market.  The 15"" transom gives you the ability to add a short shaft prop outboard motor.\n\n6 Air Chambers, 2998lbs weight capacity, maximum 10 people. Heavy duty interlocking aluminum floor system with side stringers.\n\n&nbsp;",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,90718,,,,1,,,,"Boats, Boats > Packages",,,"https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HPJ4G9S0ug.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSCF2286-29.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSCF2277-26.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20hp_fs_rp34_tiller.png__510x0_q85_autocrop_crop-scale_subsampling-2_upscale.png, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-DSCF9334_e17a00a7-723d-408b-b5b5-a424ab9400ea.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-12.31.37-PM.png, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-DSCF8964_0fc508e5-6034-4c40-af50-d8c61fb30309.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Launching-Wheels-Dualies_1.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Launching-Wheels-Dualies_2.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gas-Tank-Tie-Down-System.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSCF2305-35.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-DSCF8911_9f86f8fb-c982-421f-9427-9626f5fb1958.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSCF2415-66.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSCF2397-61.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSCF2404-62.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SCOTTY_-TRAP-EASE-WITHOUT-MOUNT.jpg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/af9bff1beddf00d950b0a430840e6ec6-rotated-1.jpeg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/07646d4c954fec2c350b67552d3e8626-rotated-1.jpeg, https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSCF0599-102.jpg",,,,,"id:347, id:348, id:1853",,,,101,color,"Blacked Out, Storm Grey",1,1,flooring,Aluminum,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blacked Out",Aluminum

We chose to build an EFI outboard because it has easy startup with no choke required and smooth, crisp acceleration throughout all RPM ranges. Another added benefit of an EFI versus our previous carbureted outboard is the fuel efficiency at wide open throttle, which allows you to go up to 50% farther on less fuel.\n\nAlso available on many models is the Power Tilt feature. The 20 hp Power Tilt is ideal for inflatable, fishing, and pontoon boats. The uniquely designed engine improves functionality and convenience with its light power tilt and transom bracket. Now you can tilt your motor out of the water with just the push of a button. Simplify your boating experience with a power tilt model. Try our new 20hp EFI for the ultimate boating experience because you don’t deserve anything less.\n\nRemote/Power Tilt models now available in Beluga White allowing boaters to choose which engine color best fits their boat.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,5403,"Outboards, Outboards > Tohatsu Boat Motors",,,https://strykerboats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tohatsu-MFS20EWEPTL-min.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inflatable boat is rated for 7 people, but we have found that this is the perfect size for 3-4 people paired with a lightweight 20HP motor.\n<h3><strong>Material &amp; Construction:</strong></h3>\nOur signature LX line features 5 <a href=""https://strykerboats.com/product/scotty-glue-on-pad-for-inflatable-boats-black/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Scotty® bases</a> pre-installed at time of manufacturing to plug and play up to 30 different <a href=""https://strykerboats.com/product-category/stryker-inflatable-boat-accessories/scotty/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Scotty® accessories</a> for all your fishing adventures.\n\nThe Stryker LX 360 comes with the additional bottom protection of 1.2mm fabric with our signature <em>Stryker Shield®</em> hull protection. <em>Stryker Shield</em>® is an 8” wide corrugated rubber strip that protects the bottom of the tubes and keel.  Stryker Inflatable Boats are constructed with the highest grade imported German Mehler PVC using the latest thermowelding technology.  Thermowelding is a process using heat welding that bonds the material together that creates superior strength and durability over the traditional 4 layer overlapping seam technology used by most companies.\n\nThe  LX 360 inflatable boat features a 15” heavy duty 1 piece reinforced aluminum transom.  The Stryker fully welded aluminum transom removes the most common failure point (wood and plastic 3 piece transoms) found on all other inflatable boats on the market.  The 15"" transom gives you the ability to add a short shaft prop outboard motor.\n\nThis vessel offers 4 Air Chambers, 1803lbs weight capacity.  Stryker Inflatable Boats are constructed with a heavy duty interlocking aluminum floor system with side stringers or a high pressure air floor constructed from a specially designed drop-stitched PVC fabric.\n<h3><strong>Motor Recommendation for the Stryker LX 360:</strong></h3>\n20HP short shaft prop outboard, manual or electric start.\n<h3><strong>Included:</strong></h3>\nEvery boat comes fully equipped with military grade wrap around life line, multiple heavy duty D-ring systems installed throughout,  fuel tank/battery box tie down, heavy duty transom motor mount, welded towing/lifting eyes on transom, towing eyes on bow, with heavy duty D-handle for use with <a href=""https://strykerboats.com/product/stryker-launching-wheels-standard/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Stryker launching wheel system</a>.
