Note: If your site utilizes any 3rd party optimizing/caching plugins, please exclude RBC's JavaScript and CSS files from these plugins. Also, because our plugin relies on the native jQuery version (1.12.4) provided by WordPress, please ensure your store does not pull in any other jQuery scripts, which may interfere with our plugin's functionality.
